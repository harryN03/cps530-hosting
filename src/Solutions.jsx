    <div>
      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Solution 1: I look for help from my friend, who are more familiar with React, and some online sources available in Youtube. One of them is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PedroTechnologies" target="_blank">Pedro Tech</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Solution 2: Same as the first challenge, I sought for advise from some of my friends. However, all of them were not free. Therefore, I need to search information online to see if I could host my webpage free. 
          After extensive research, I stumbled upon GitHub Pages, a free hosting service provided by GitHub. Leveraging this platform, I successfully hosted my webpage, overcoming the initial hurdle and gaining valuable insights into the world of web hosting.
